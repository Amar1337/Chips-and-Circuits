From every gate, there are 6 dimentions (N,S,E,W, up, down)

Every circuit connecting two gates moves within a cube of 18 by 13 by 7 (layers)

The total number of connections for 3 dimensions  is (18+13+7)! = 42! = 1.41e51 of 1.41x10^51

This we divide by the dimensions 42!/ (18! * 13! * 7!)  = 7, 00e21 of 7,00*10^21 

This is for one connection. Every next connection has this value minus the last used possibility…
This however only accounts for the the movement one way in every direction. If direction needs to be inverse to avoid collisions, every direction needs movement both ways

For two directions you need (18+18+13+13+7+7)! = 76!

This makes the total number of possibilities 76! / (18!*18!*13!*13!*7!*7!) = 4,67e52

So…. considering, this should happen for every of the 30 connections that need to be made in the first set of  print 1.

What remains is question is how to discount the probabilities where circuits intersect another gate or circuit?
